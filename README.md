# Coding exercise for David Konsumer's Shiftwise application.

[Here](http://konsumer.github.io/shiftwise-cards-react/) is a running example of this code.

## dev tools

*  `npm install` - Install dependencies and tools. You will need to have [nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
* `npm start` - run a development webserver
* `npm test` - run tests
* `npm run build` - run the build for static deployment
* `npm run deploy` - deploy the optimized static static site to github pages.

## style notes

* I used [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard)
* I implemented everything using ES6 ReactJS, including classes and other new keywords. I included compatability builds for legacy browsers.

# original asignment

As part of the job application process at ShiftWise, we ask candidates to complete several small coding exercises before coming in for an in-person interview. The exercises are listed below. Please review all the provided guidelines before you begin.

## THE EXERCISES

Please complete both of the following exercises, being sure to follow all the guidelines listed below.

1. Write a method, function, or procedure that sorts a standard deck of 52 playing cards in ascending order. You are free to determine what the term ‚Äúascending order‚Äù means for a deck of cards, but be ready to discuss your choice during the interview.
2. Write a method, function, or procedure that randomly shuffles a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

## ABOUT THE PROBLEMS

Complete the exercises using C#, JavaScript, or T-SQL. You may opt to use another language, but please consider the following important points:

* C#, JavaScript, and T-SQL are the primary languages we use here at ShiftWise.
* We need to be able to evaluate your work! If you complete the exercises in another language, make sure it‚Äôs easy for anyone to run your tests and debug your code without installing lots of additional software.
* When in doubt, please ask. Contact your recruiter and inform them of your proposal. You should presume this code will be used in a variety of games that all use a standard deck of 52 playing cards (four suits of thirteen cards each). Given this purpose, create whatever types, modules, and structures you feel are necessary to complete the exercises.

In all cases, write automated tests for your work. Use whatever testing framework you prefer. Structure the tests as you see fit. Write as many tests as you feel are necessary and sufficient to build ‚Äúshippable‚Äù, customer-ready  confidence in your code. You may use TDD or BDD if you prefer, but it's not required. The testing approach, technique, and technology are entirely up to you, but you should be ready to explain and advocate for your approach.

It should go without saying that all your automated tests should pass. :)

Write code to suit yourself. Please don‚Äôt try to guess what we "really want": We just want to see your code! üòÉ

Show us how you prefer to work. Show us code you‚Äôre proud of. Keep it as simple as you‚Äôd like; or, if you prefer, show us a really sophisticated algorithm. The choice is yours!

In any case, be ready to discuss and modify your work in the interview!

## ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY

We must be able to read and run your results. To that end:

* Do not reference any code or libraries that require a paid license or subscription.
* Do not use any frameworks or libraries that aren't available for use by the general public.
* Do not use code or libraries that are protected by copyright, intellectual property rights, or any other restriction that prevents free sharing and use of the code or libraries.

All work will be evaluated on a computer running Windows 7.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES

When you're done, please put your work in a shared location where we can pick it up and let us know it is there and how to get it by sending an email to the [following address](mailto:code_samples@shiftwise.net).

Or if you prefer, we can create a drop location on our corporate BOX and send you a link. Use the email address above to make your request.

Do NOT send your coding exercise by email because our corporate firewall will keep us from receiving it.

## PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:

* Include your name with the results so we know whose work we‚Äôre reviewing.
* Be sure to include any configuration files required to run your tests.
* Do not include binaries in the .zip file. Do not send compiled DLL's, do not send executables, etc.
* If necessary, be sure to include package management scripts so we can obtain any referenced libraries (nuget and npm both work fine).
* Your results are due no later than 9 am Pacific on the day prior to the scheduled day for your in-person interview. Late results will not be accepted.

In working out your solutions, please feel free to use whatever resources you find helpful in your day-to-day work (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), but be ready to explain and modify your code during the in-person interview. Finally, while these are obviously contrived exercises, do your best to regard them as real work. Write and organize your code the same way you would if it was a real, paid assignment writing software for real, paying customers. Best wishes! We look forward to seeing your work!
